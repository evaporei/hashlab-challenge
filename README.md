## Installation

To install the project you will need `Docker` and `docker-compose`. There are script files at the [`scripts`](https://github.com/otaviopace/hashlab-challenge/blob/master/scripts) folder which will ease the use of both of these tools.

### Setup

For now the only thing the setup does is to copy the example `.env` files into real ones.

```shell
./scripts/setup.sh
```
